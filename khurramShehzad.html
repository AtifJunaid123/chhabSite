    <div class="card" id="history">
      <h2>History of GBHS Chhab</h2>
      <p>This area was deprived of educational facilities. During British rule, there was a major cholera epidemic in the village. Sufi Sheikh Ahmed Hussain, a well-respected and honorable individual, made efforts to establish this institution to provide free and compulsory education to the people. Around 1922, he gathered people for a meeting to discuss the importance of education and the need for an educational institution.</p>
      <p>The foundation of this school was laid in 1926 with the prayers and support of the community. After Pakistan's independence, the need for an educational institution was further emphasized. Since then, this school has been contributing significantly to educating and guiding young minds.</p>
      <p>The notable achievement came in 1951 when the school gained recognition and respect. It became the only institution in the area providing education up to the middle level and was acknowledged as a model institution for promoting religious and modern education.</p>
      <p>The school has since been striving to uphold its values and fulfill its mission to provide quality education and enlighten students in this area.</p>
